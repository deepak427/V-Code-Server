Digit rearrangement method to find next greater number with same set of digits
Write an algorithm to find out next greater number to given number with the same set of digits Asked in : Morgan Stanley, Makemytrip, Amazon. Ex. Input 1: A = [1, 2, 3] Output 1:[1, 3, 2], Input 2: A = [3, 2, 1] Output 2: [1, 2, 3]
Given an array, of size n, reverse it
Given an array, of size n, reverse it. Example: If array, arr = [1,2,3,4,5], after reversing it, the array should be, arr = [5,4,3,2,1] .
Use bubble sort algorithm to sort array
You are given an unsorted array consisting of N non-negative integers. Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.Ex. Bubble Sort implementation for the given array:  [6,2,8,4,10] is array: [2,4,6,8,10]. 
Maximum Swap
You are given an integer num. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number. Return the maximum valued number you can get.Ex. Input: num = 2736 Output: 7236
Use Selection sort algorithm to sort array
You are given an unsorted array consisting of N non-negative integers. Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the Selection Sort algorithm.Ex. Selection Sort implementation for the given array:  [6,2,8,4,10] is array: [2,4,6,8,10].
